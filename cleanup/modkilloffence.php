Modkillable Offences

These are the following reasons of which you can be Modkilled, by a <u>MOD</u> or <u>Admin</u>.

<b>1. Duping</b>

Duping is when you have more than one account belonging to yourself.
However we fully understand that more than one account may be on one IP, as relatives may play the game, therefore, if we see ANY [u]Money Transfers[/u], [u]Deals[/u] or [u]OCs together[/u], you will be classed as a dupe, and Modkilled.
We do not care if the account really is your brothers/mothers/sisters/hamsters! If its on the same Ip, your a dupe, simple as.
This measure is needed to stop cheats taking over the game and saying the account is their relatives!

<b>2. Abuse</b>

We will class abuse as any inappropriate abuse which is [u]not[/u] involved with FH (Football Hooligans). We also class abuse as real life threats to a player.
Both of these offences will be treat with a Modkill.
We do this to ensure the safety of our players.

<b>3. User Request</b>

If you would like to die for any reason, then simply message a MOD or the Head MOD, and request a Modkill and they will do it without problem.

<b>4. Hacking / Attempted Hacking / Threatening To Hack</b>

If you are caught hacking / Attempting to hack / Or even threatening to hack another player(s), then you will also be modkilled and possibly IP banned.
This is too ensure the safety of our users' accounts.

<b>5. Hacked</b>

If you are hacked, 99.99% of the time it will be your fault.
Therefore I have devised the following steps to avoid you being hacked.

+ Change your password every fortnight.
+ When registering, do <u>not</u> register the same e-mail adress as your hotmail account, as if this is hacked, they can hack your account on FH.
+ Make sure your Hotmail accounts Password, Secret Question and Secret Answer are those of which you, and only you will know.
+ Never, ever tell anybody your password, not even our staff (Admin, Head MOD, MODs, Forum MODs, HDOPs) under any circumstances whatsoever!
+ Make sure your password is not easy to guess!

If you are hacked, and we do not feel that these steps have been followed, then you will be Modkilled and you will <b>NOT</b> be Modrezzed.
This is because we feel that your account is your account and nobody else should have it (Corresponding with Reason 6).

<b>6. Sold Account / Purcahsed Account / Attemtping To Sell Account / Attempting To Purcahse Account</b>

If you are seen trying to sell your account, or if you have sold your account, if you are trying to purcahse an account, or if you have purchased an account, you will be Modkilled without warning!
This is because here at FH, we feel that you, and only you, should rank up your account. This is why to stop the sales of accounts as somebody else has done some of the hard work for you!

<b>6. Bug Expoliter</b>

If you are found out to have exploited any bugs to give yourself an advantage in the game, you will be Modkilled without caution, and possibly IP Banned.
When you find any bugs, or anything of which you feel is not right, you should report it to Admin or MOD immediatley!

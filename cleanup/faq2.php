      <p>Ways to protect your account<br>
      </p>
      <p>1. Never ever give out your password unless it&rsquo;s someone you can really trust. <br>
        If you encounter a message or a topic stating that (username) requires your password DON&rsquo;T GIVE IT. Admins, Moderators and Help Desk Operators never require the use of your password so if you get a message saying that FenchurchX or MonkeyAvengerV2 require your password don&rsquo;t listen. It&rsquo;s nothing more then a scam to take control of your account.</p>
      <p>2. Never click on a link while you are logged in to your account. If you find a link in the forums saying something like: click this link to receive 100 points&hellip;<br>
        9 times out of 10 it will be a scam. Always log out of your account and any other accounts online (e.g. e-mail or bank accounts) before clicking on any links.</p>
      <p>3. Don&rsquo;t share your account with anyone. Not even trusted friends.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>General</p>
      <p>Daily Newspaper</p>
      <p>The Daily Newspaper is a page where Admins, Moderators or Writers post all the latest news and details. All the essential information regarding Empire 2010 such as competitions or new features can be found on the Daily Newspaper. Keep an eye out!</p>
      <p>Gangsters Online</p>
      <p>This is where you can view all the players, Admins, Mods and Hdo&rsquo;s that are online. [color=blue]Admins[/color] are displayed in [color=blue]Blue[/color]. [color=red]Mods[/color] are displayed in [color=red]Red[/color] and [color=green]Hdo&rsquo;s[/color] are displayed in[color=green]Green[/color].<br>
        Crew owners are displayed as [b]Bold[/b]<br>
        An RHM of a crew is displayed as [i]Italics[/i]<br>
        Property or Casino owners are displayed as [u]Underlined[/u]<br>
        Your friends are displayed in [color=yellow]Yellow[/color](Once they&rsquo;re added to your friends list)</p>
      <p>The International</p>
      <p>The Head writer and his team of Reporters and Writers write an article once every week. Each article tells a different story about Empire 2010 and includes the latest news and stories that have occurred in Empire 2010. Some articles include interviews with players that achieved an extraordinary feat or the Empire 2010 staff for their views or news on features that will be making their way to the shelves soon.</p>
      <p>Your Crew</p>
      <p>If you own a crew or are a [i]RHM[/i] of a crew, this page allows you to survey general info on your crew. [b]Crew Bosses[/b] and [i]RHM&rsquo;s[/i] also get a special page where they can hand over control to a different member or invite players to join the crew or kick players from the crew.</p>
      <p>If you are a normal member of a crew then this page shows you standard info on your crew. You can also deposit money into the crew bank via the page as well as buying businesses to generate income for the crewmembers.</p>
      <p>Find Gangsters</p>
      <p>Here you can enter a person&rsquo;s name as well as whether they&rsquo;re alive or dead and see the results. If more then 1 player has the name (e.g. Thunder would also have ThunderX and ThunderV2) then all the names will appear. You can also use this page to search for Empire 2010 staffs that aren&rsquo;t online as well as players who aren&rsquo;t online.</p>
      <p>Photo Album</p>
      <p>The Photo Album contains pictures of Empire 2010 staff as well as normal players who have given links to their personal pictures. To give your link, you need to host your picture on a free hosting site (see miscellaneous at the top).</p>
      <p>Airport</p>
      <p>This is where you can travel via a Plane to different countries. You can also buy Planes from The Underground. If you don&rsquo;t own a plane, then you have to wait an hour between travelling. The more expensive your plane is, the better it is! The most expensive plane lets you wait a mere 15 minutes between travelling.</p>
      <p>Kill</p>
      <p>Here you can either search for a player, or if you&rsquo;ve already found one then you can kill him/her. Admins and Moderators cannot be killed.<br>
        To search for a player, you need to enter his/her name in the space below &lsquo;Hunt&rsquo; and then enter a time as well as where you want to search.</p>
      <p>Once you have searched for a player you need to enter the amount of bullets you want to fire. Be warned, the higher the rank and the better protection the target has, will mean the higher the weapon and/or the higher the number of bullets you will need to shoot at the target.</p>
      <p>The Underground</p>
      <p>The Underground is the place where you can buy all the necessities. From guns, to protection to planes &ndash; all the useful items that you&rsquo;ll need in Empire 2010.</p>
      <p>The more expensive the equipment or plane, the better it is. The best weapon will allow you to use fewer bullets against a target.<br>
        The best protection means your attacker will need more bullets to kill you.<br>
        The best planes &ndash; (See Airport)</p>
      <p>Sell</p>
      <p>Here you can sell items that you have. You can collect items by buying them from an auction, or by receiving them from a successful crime instead of money.</p>
      <p>Auctions</p>
      <p>Auctions are a place where players can bit for items. Cars and bullets are the most common items to be sold at an auction. <br>
        Private auctions take place between two people, and are used to give a person item(s) that cannot be given any other way (e.g. bullets).</p>
      <p>Hitlist</p>
      <p>The Hitlist is where players can be placed in a list, along with a price. Once the player on the Hitlist has been killed, the price beside his name will immediately be transferred to your account. Be careful! Powerful friends may protect the target&hellip;</p>
      <p>Donate</p>
      <p>Donations to Empire 2010 cost just &pound;1 and every donation helps to keep the web-server in tip-top condition.<br>
        However, you will need a PayPal account and a [u]valid[/u] credit card to donate.<br>
        You will also be given &pound;25,000 - &pound;1,000,000 game cash as a result of how much you donate! Pretty cool eh?</p>
      <p>Points</p>
      <p>Points are a reward system. You give money to the game, and you get points in return. The more money you give, the more points you get and more items you can purchase. Below is a list of the items/conditions for purchase and the amount of points needed, as well as how much points cost. The same information can be found on the [i]Points[/i] page in the game.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Countries</p>
      <p>This page allows you to see various information on the different Countries. You can view all the businesses owned, as well as the owners. You can also see the Bullet prices and Casino prices for that particular Country.<br>
        If no one owns a particular business, you can travel to the Country where it is and pick it up.</p>
      <p>Attempts</p>
      <p>Here you can view any attempts players have made on your life. If their attempt was successful, then you can&rsquo;t visit this page as your dead! <br>
        If their attempt was unsuccessful, then their name(s) as well as the time they shot you will be listed. Go out and get some revenge!</p>
      <p>Jail</p>
      <p>There are many reasons that you can be put in Jail. For a failed Crime, Gta, Mission or Oc as well as others. <br>
        If you have been put in Jail, then you have to wait a certain time before you are free. Other players who aren&rsquo;t in Jail can bust you out.<br>
        Busting people in Jail is a long and tiring job, but it can earn you fame and rewards from other players who appreciate the favour. The more people you bust out of jail, the easier it becomes for you to bust other people out &ndash; especially higher ranks.</p>
      <p>If you have been put in Jail by a failed Mission attempt or a failed Oc, then your name will have a small symbol next to it. The symbol represents the fact that you are &lsquo;unbreakable&rsquo; from jail, and you have no choice but to sit patiently until the timer runs out.</p>
      <p>Restaurant</p>
      <p>The Restaurant is a necessity in Empire 2010. Here you can buy food that is exchanged as energy. You need energy to increase your chances of a successful Crime, Gta or an Oc. Keep those energy levels filled up!</p>
      <p>The Bar</p>
      <p>The Bar is only open to players who are ranked &lsquo;Gangster&rsquo; or above. The players can buy drinks for other people.<br>
        Beers are the most sought out drink. They allow a random number of rank points to be added to a player&rsquo;s bar, although you cannot buy them for yourself. Someone else has to buy a Beer for you.<br>
        You can only buy 1 drink every 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The Hospital</p>
      <p>The Hospital is available for people who have been injured either by a failed Oc attempt, or by a failure for the attacker to shoot enough bullets into their head.<br>
        The Hospital charges a cheap rate per hour. Every hour spent in the Hospital replenishes 10% of your health.</p>
      <p>Safe House</p>
      <p>Here you have to spend money to be protected by the safe house. The safe house charges money per [u]minute[/u].<br>
        While you are in a Safe House, you cannot be killed.<br>

        Here you can create your own topics, or talk in others.</p>
      <p>Mafia Club</p>
      <p>The Mafia Club is an online chat room, where anyone can discuss whatever they want, freely.<br>
        To refresh the chat room, click the refresh button near the top of the chat room window.</p>
      <p>Crew Forum</p>
      <p>If you are in a crew, the crew forum page is available. It can only be seen by the members of the same crew.<br>
        Different crews have their own Forums.<br>
        In the crew forum, the Crew Boss, RHM or council members can post topics as well as the normal members of the crew. They can discuss an attack or just events that have either happened, or will be happening. <br>
        Each Crew Boss has a different rule to keeping the Crew Forum. Make sure you read their rules!</p>
      <p>IRC Chat</p>
      <p>IRC Chat is a separate chat room that requires the use of particular software (e.g. Java).<br>
        Here you can talk with people all over the world. Certain games have their own channels or certain groups have their own set of channels.</p>
      <p>Helpdesk</p>
      <p>This page allows you to send tickets to Help Desk Operators, with any queries or questions that you have about Empire 2010. Hopefully, this FAQ will give you a solid amount of Information, but the Help Desk Operators are always there to help!</p>
      <p>Once you have sent a Help Desk Ticket, please note that the reply to the ticket will appear in the [u]Help Desk Page[/u], not your Inbox.</p>
      <p>Tickets that hold no relevance to Empire 2010, or include questions or topics with no relevance to the game [u]will[/u] be deleted.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In Game Actions</p>
      <p>Bullet Factory</p>
      <p>The Bullet Factory is quite simply &ndash; where you buy bullets. The Bullet Factory owners can choose the price of each bullet.<br>
        Sometimes, owners will &lsquo;close&rsquo; the Factory for a short period of time to stock up on bullets. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed if they do!</p>
      <p>Steal A Car</p>
      <p>Also known as &lsquo;Gta&rsquo; or &lsquo;Grand Theft Auto&rsquo;, Steal A Car is basically what it says on the tin. You steal a car.<br>
        Can&rsquo;t get much simpler then that!<br>
        Once you have stolen a car, it is automatically transferred to your garage. The higher your skill with stealing a car, the better the car you can get away with.</p>
      <p>Drugs</p>
      <p>Here you control your drug operations. Some missions require you to buy drugs from one country and transfer them to another.<br>
        The higher your rank, the more drugs you can carry. The more drugs you transport, the less your chances are of getting caught.<br>
        Below is a list of ranks and the number of drugs that can be carried at one time:</p>
      <p>Rank Drugs<br>
        God 99 Units<br>
        Godfather 65 Units<br>
        Druglord 55 Units<br>
        Underboss 50 Units<br>
        Consigliere 45 Units<br>
        Capo 40 Units<br>
        Made Man 35 Units<br>
        Piciotto 30 Units<br>
        Associate 25 Units<br>
        Gangster 20 Units<br>
        Robber 15 Units<br>
        Thief 10 Units<br>
        Paper Kid 5 Units<br>
        Tramp 2 Units</p>
      <p>Crime Scene</p>
      <p>Crimes are the standard way of making money. The harder the crime, the more money you receive as well as receiving more rank points.<br>
        You can earn anywhere between &pound;100 - &pound;10,000 via crimes.<br>
        You can only do one crime every 2 minutes.</p>
      <p>Bank</p>
      <p>The bank is where you receive or give money to another player. The owner of the bank chooses the interest rate. The interest rate is given to the owner once the transaction is done.</p>
      <p>e.g. You have &pound;500 to give to another player. The interest rate is 10%. 10% of &pound;500 is &pound;50. The other player only receives &pound;450 while the bank owner receives &pound;50.</p>
      <p>Swiss Bank</p>
      <p>A Swiss bank account will remain throughout Empire 2010 unless the game has been reset.<br>
        Once you make a Swiss bank account, you receive your bank number and personal pin number. You can place as much money as you want in your Swiss account.<br>
        If your account gets banned or killed for any reason, then you can still access your Swiss account and your money once you have made a new account.</p>
      <p>Missions</p>
      <p>Missions can make you rich in a very short time. They are fun and mostly easy to do.<br>
        Missions vary, from drug runs (transporting drugs from different countries) to stealing cars or killing people. Whatever the mission, you&rsquo;ll receive a money and/or bullet reward once the mission is complete. You will also receive a message in your Inbox, telling you of how much money and/or bullets you have received.</p>
      <p>Organised Crime</p>
      <p>Organised Crime or &lsquo;Oc&rsquo; is a team of players who buy equipment to rob a bank. There are four people in every team, no more, no less. A leader, driver, WE (or Weapons Expert) and an EE (or Explosives Expert). Each member of the team has to buy equipment, the more you buy and the more expensive it is, the better the chance of you receiving more money from the Oc. <br>
        If a member doesn&rsquo;t buy enough equipment, or just cheap equipment, then there is a high chance that the Oc will fail and you will be placed in Jail.<br>
        If you fail an Oc, you&rsquo;ll be unbreakable in Jail, meaning you have to wait around 5 minutes or more before you can attempt another crime.</p>
      <p>You can only do an Oc once every 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Extortion</p>
      <p>Extortion is like crimes, except that you steal money or items from other people. You can make a decent amount of money from Extortion, but you&rsquo;ll end up getting more items then money.</p>
      <p>Territory</p>
      <p>Crews or Individuals can own territories. If you own a territory, you can end up making a large amount of money.<br>
        Once your account is banned or killed, your territory is available to other players. They have the option of taking it over.</p>
      <p>Arm Wrestling</p>
      <p>Arm wrestling is a great way of making money although it&rsquo;s very time-consuming. <br>
        Basically, you can train up your Arm Wrestling levels by completing training exercises. For every 100% worth of exercises you complete, you go up a level.<br>
        You also have the option of challenging an opponent or starting a challenge set by an opponent. The prize is cash, and the higher your level is, the better your chances are of winning.</p>
      <p>Crews</p>
      <p>A Crew is a group of people who have come together, either for the same beliefs or because they have a close friendship.<br>
        A crew consists of a Crew Boss, an RHM (or Right Hand Man) and the members.<br>
        The crew boss may decide to appoint a crew counsel or Hitsquad leader, although that&rsquo;s his/her decision.<br>
        The Crew Boss also usually has rules in the crew forum that every member must obey. In times of war, the crewmembers are expected to fight against the attackers, and help their fellow crewmembers out.<br>
        Crews usually only recruit Gangster or higher, although some Crews only recruit close friends. The crew expectations for recruiting members are stated on the crew boss&rsquo;s profile or the crew profile.<br>

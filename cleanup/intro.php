<p>The year is 2010 and the South East of England lays in ruins after a devastating terrorist attack. You awake from the smouldering smoke and metal in your home town of Colchester only to find you’ve been stripped of everything you own except the clothes on your back.
    The land is in a state of ruin, looters run the street stealing what they can only to have it stolen back off them by the many alliances formed through the catastrophe. 
    You have to get back to your feet, you have to steal, cheat, gamble and kill your way to safety. Do whatever it takes to survive in the new Empire!
